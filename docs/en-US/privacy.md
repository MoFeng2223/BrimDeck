# Data and privacy

BrimDeck reads only the sign-in state and usage records that apps already keep. It never changes, renews or ends their sign-ins, never uploads conversations, and collects no usage data.

## Data read

| Tool | Quota | Tokens and cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | Reads the Claude Code sign-in (`%USERPROFILE%\.claude\.credentials.json`), or the Claude desktop app's sign-in when that is unavailable, and asks Anthropic for the account usage. Each row can turn off "Fetch quota online": such a row reads no sign-in and sends nothing, and shows only the quota the Claude desktop app recorded on this PC (`plan-usage-history.json`) | Reads the local Claude Code session records (`projects\**\*.jsonl`); regular chats in the Claude desktop app are not included |
| Codex | Reads the sign-in in `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\auth.json` and asks OpenAI for the account usage; if that fails, shows the quota from the session records and marks it as possibly out of date | Reads the local session records (`sessions` and `archived_sessions`) |
| Antigravity | Reads from the local service of the running Antigravity desktop app (127.0.0.1 only) | Reads the local conversation databases of the desktop app and the CLI under `%USERPROFILE%\.gemini` |
| Cursor | Reads the Cursor sign-in from `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\globalStorage\state.vscdb` in read-only mode and asks Cursor for the account usage | Asks Cursor for the account usage details, including usage on other devices |
| ZCode | Reads the ZCode sign-in and asks for the Coding Plan, Start Plan and MCP daily limits | Reads the local request records (`%USERPROFILE%\.zcode\cli\db\db.sqlite`) |
| Zhipu GLM, Z.ai GLM, New API, Sub2API, Custom | Uses the key and site address entered in settings | Not available |

- When `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME` or `ZCODE_HOME` is set to an absolute path, that folder is read instead.
- These account APIs and local data formats are not stable public interfaces. When they cannot be read, the panel shows the actual status and never makes up numbers.

## Files stored on this PC

All files are stored in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BrimDeck`:

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `settings.json` | Settings; no sign-in tokens or API keys |
| `secrets.dat` | API keys you entered, encrypted by Windows for the current user |
| `model-prices.json`, `manual-model-prices.json` | Updated model prices, and prices you added |
| `update-prompt.txt`, `updates\` | The last version you were told about, and downloaded installers |
| `crash.log` | Error records; cleared when it exceeds 1 MB |

## Network and security

- Connects only to: each tool's official APIs, sites you enter in settings, the OpenRouter model list (model prices), lyrics services (LRCLIB, NetEase Cloud Music, QQ Music), the cover addresses players provide, and GitHub Releases (updates).
- Sign-in tokens are used only in memory and never written to disk; the Claude desktop app's sign-in cache is decrypted in memory with Windows encryption for the current user.
- Custom scripts run in a sandbox with no access to files, processes or .NET objects; see the limits in [Supported tools](ai-tools.md#custom-script).
- The sound behind the equalizer is analyzed only in memory and never saved.

## NetEase Cloud Music full control

- Full control needs NetEase Cloud Music to open a local debugging port. When enabled from BrimDeck, the port is 127.0.0.1:21631.
- While the port is open, other programs on this PC and web pages in a browser may use it to control NetEase Cloud Music and read its page content and sign-in state.
- Before connecting, BrimDeck checks that the port listens only on this PC and belongs to NetEase Cloud Music, but this cannot remove the risk of the port itself.
- Turn it on only in an environment you trust. Starting NetEase Cloud Music the normal way ends full control.
