# Clipboard and file transfer

The "Clipboard and file transfer" page of the open panel has two columns: the clipboard history on the left and the file transfer on the right. Their settings are under Settings › Clipboard and Settings › File transfer; the page's switch and size are under Settings › Expanded view.

## Clipboard

BrimDeck keeps the text and pictures you copy, newest first.

- **Display**: text shows its first line, with the number of further lines at the end; a link shows its domain and path in two colors, code in a monospaced font, a color value with a swatch, and a picture as a thumbnail with its size.
- **Click**: pastes the entry into the window you are working in.
- **Right-click**: Paste, Paste as plain text, Copy only, Details, Edit (text), Add to category, Add to favorites, Delete.
- **Details**: the whole panel shows the entry in full, with the app it came from, the time, and its length or size; a link can be opened in the browser.
- **Drag out**: drag the entry into another app.

### How long entries are kept

- The history is stored on this PC, encrypted by Windows.
- Ordinary entries are cleared when BrimDeck exits.
- What is in Favorites, or in a category set to "Kept", stays until you delete it.
- One entry holds up to 1,000,000 characters; longer copies are not recorded.

### What is not recorded

- With "Record the clipboard" off under Settings › Clipboard, nothing is recorded.
- Copies from the apps under "Apps not recorded" are not recorded.
- Copies that an app marks as not to be kept in clipboard history, as password managers do, are not recorded.

### Favorites and phrases

Favorites is the fixed first category, and what is in it is always kept. Right-click any entry and choose "Add to favorites" to put it there.

A phrase is text you write directly, without copying it first: choose "New phrase" under Settings › Clipboard › Favorites, type it and save.

## File transfer

The file transfer holds files you will need shortly. It keeps only where each file is, never a copy, and the original files are not touched.

- **Put in**: drag files or folders onto the notch, the capsule or the open panel. Dragged onto the collapsed panel, it opens on this page; move away without dropping and the panel goes back to how it was. You can also drop onto a category's name.
- **Click**: pastes the file into the current window. It becomes an attachment in a chat window, and a copy in the current folder in File Explorer.
- **Select several**: hold Ctrl or Shift and click to select several files, then paste, drag out or remove them together.
- **Right-click**: Paste, Open, Show in folder, Copy path, Details, Add to category, Remove from the file transfer, Delete the original.
- **Drag out**: drag a file to where you need it; a button in the column's title row drags out all files at once. Files are copied by default; with "Move" chosen under Settings › File transfer › Drag files out, files moved to a new place leave the list, while chat apps, browsers and other places that only take copies still get copies.
- A file whose original has been moved or deleted is marked "Missing".
- The notch and capsule can show how many files the file transfer holds.

## Categories and search

- The clipboard and the file transfer each have their own categories, made, renamed, reordered and deleted under Settings › Clipboard and Settings › File transfer. An entry or a file can be in several categories.
- Each category can have a rule for what goes in by itself. The clipboard's conditions cover the kind of content, the text (contains, starts with, ends with, a built-in format or a regular expression), a link's domain and the app it was copied from; the file transfer's cover the file type, extension, file name and folder. Several conditions can require any or all of them.
- A clipboard category can be set to "Kept" or "Cleared on exit".
- The search button at the top right of the page searches the clipboard and the file transfer together.

## Where the data is stored

The clipboard history, the file transfer's list and the categories are stored in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BrimDeck\shelf.dat`, and copied pictures in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BrimDeck\shelf\`. Both are encrypted for the current Windows user, used only on this PC and never uploaded. See [Data and privacy](privacy.md).
